<blockquote>
  <p><span class="newthought">This article tracks</span>  the evolution of the regulatory framework in relation to transport noise in England from private and public nuisances in common law to the defence of statutory authority. The article looks at the evolution of transport noise law focusing primarily on the emergence of turnpike roads in the eighteenth century, railways in the nineteenth century, the extension of road motor vehicles in the verge of the twentieth century and, lastly, the introduction of jet aircraft after World War II. The introduction of these noise sources shaped the current noise regulatory framework in England. Traffic noise in England enjoys protection against nuisance claims. Nowadays, the British Parliament is reluctant to remove citizen’s private rights, and express statutory authority has appeared in very few legislative provisions, save when these have been juxtaposed with some form of statutory remedy —which was not present in early English jurisprudence on transport noise.

<h2 id="s0005">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Part of the current English legislation in transport noise is the result
of the transposition of European Directives as a consequence of the
United Kingdom’s (UK’s) membership of the European Economic Community
(EEC) from 1 January 1973 to 31 January 2020 when it left the European
Union (EU). Nevertheless, a substantial number of elements of current
English policy and legislation predate this period.</p>

<p>Noise nuisance has been addressed by English common law since medieval times.<label for="sn3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The National Archives, <a href="#b0280">1302</a><a name="bb0280"></a> </span>
Current judicial philosophy in relation to noise is already present in
eighteenth century case law.<label for="sn4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Kerse, <a href="#b0150">1975</a><a name="bb0150"></a>, Lucas, <a href="#b0175">1989</a><a name="bb0175"></a> citing Gearty,
<a href="#bib423">1986</a><a name="bbib423"></a> </span> Statutory authority defence against
noise claims originated in the same period.<label for="sn5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bassford,
<a href="#b0020">2007</a><a name="bb0020"></a>, Kerse, <a href="#b0150">1975</a><a name="bb0150"></a>,
Wilde, <a href="#b0410">2017</a><a name="bb0410"></a> </span> The introduction of the railway in
the early nineteenth century, of motor-vehicles in the late nineteenth century
and of aircraft in the twentieth century —specifically, jet aircraft after
World War II (WWII)— generated new distinguishable sources of noise which did
not form part of the acoustic character of the country until they were
introduced and, therefore, new noise problems which required having to interpret
the law in view of these new transport noise sources.</p>

<p>There is extensive literature on the initial issues created by noise produced by
new means of transport such as the railway in the early nineteenth century,<label for="sn6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn6" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Brenner, <a href="#b0040">1974</a><a name="bb0040"></a>, Jeans,

England.<label for="sn7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn7" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Abbott et al., <a href="#b0005">2015</a><a name="bb0005"></a>,

the current situation and to concrete issues at the time of publishing, rather
than in a comprehensive way. It is therefore difficult to interpret why slightly
different defences against noise claims are applied to different means of
transport —railways, roads and aircraft—, and whether these defences have
been interpreted in the same way in different periods. This paper intends to
provide a clear and comprehensive review of the evolution of noise law in
England, approaching rail, road and aircraft from their origin through their
development, and to present.</p>

<p>This paper is targeted to the transport sector and any communities or
professionals with an interest in assessing environmental impacts. It aims to
respond, first, to whether the current interpretation of the law is the same as
its original intent; and, second, whether the same laws apply to all forms of
transport.</p>

<p>There is extensive literature on the effects of noise and on current noise
legislation.<label for="sn8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn8" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Berglund et al., <a href="#b0030">1999</a><a name="bb0030"></a>, Berglund and Lindvall, <a href="#b0025">1995</a><a name="bb0025"></a>,

Atrahasis, which is not commonly mentioned as the potential first reference to a
noise complaint. There is also literature on statutory authority protection.<label for="sn10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn10" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bassford, <a href="#b0020">2007</a><a name="bb0020"></a>, Brubaker,
<a href="#b0060">1995</a><a name="bb0060"></a>, Moor, <a href="#b0210">2011</a><a name="bb0210"></a> </span> However, we have not found a comprehensive review
considering each of the forms of transport from the times of the Canal Mania to
the introduction of aircraft.</p>

<h2 id="s0010">2. Methodology</h2>

<p>Current and past regulations, case law and reports archived in The National
Archives (London) as well as research articles and books on the topic of
transport noise have been reviewed with the aim of clearly identifying how
different concepts related to English law on noise evolved during history until
nowadays. From a first group of documents covering different time frames and
means of transport, snowball sampling<label for="sn11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn11" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Goodman,
<a href="#b0120">1961</a><a name="bb0120"></a> </span> was used to identify further references
to cover the gaps identified during the literature review. Information on early
issues related to road motor noise was only found in hard copies of ministerial
reports in The National Archives.</p>

<p>The structure of this paper is content-related clustering. To contextualise
noise in human sociocultural evolution, the discussion in <a href="#s0020">section 3.1</a> includes
the first noise complaint ever recorded in ancient Mesopotamia. Notwithstanding,
the focus of this article is on England and it therefore primarily draws from
nineteenth and early and mid-twentieth century documents.</p>

<p>The article focuses on the evolution of the law in England to retain the
references to a single regulatory framework. Most of the points discussed in
this article are also applicable to the other countries in Great Britain, but
some may not. London could be considered a distinctly differentiated area where
some of the described points may not apply either.</p>

<p>In relation to other countries with a predominance of common law, it is notable
that compensation is embedded in the United States of America’s Constitution
through its Fifth Amendment.<label for="sn12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn12" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Linden, <a href="#b0170">1966</a><a name="bb0170"></a> </span>. In Canada, planning can deprive of both rights and
compensation in regulated sectors<label for="sn13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn13" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Brubaker, <a href="#b0060">1995</a><a name="bb0060"></a> </span> Therefore, the findings of this paper are not considered
to be strictly applicable to these countries.</p>

<h2 id="s0015">3. Review</h2>

<h3 id="s0020">3.1. “The first noise complaint ever recorded”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>«The land grew extensive, The people numerous, The land was bellowing
like a bull. At their din the god distressed. Enlil heard their cry.
He addressed the great gods, The cry of mankind has become burdensome
to me, Because of their din I am deprived of sleep»</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These lines are part of <em>Atrahasis</em>, a Mesopotamian epic of the second millennia
BC as translated by Lambert and Millard <a href="#b0160">(1968)</a><a name="bb0160"></a> as
cited in Moran <a href="#b0215">(1971)</a><a name="bb0215"></a>. In the epic, Enlil, a
Mesopotamian man-like god<label for="sn14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn14" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Millard, <a href="#b0205">1966</a><a name="bb0205"></a> </span> wants to eliminate humankind due to the noise disturbance
caused by people, which deprives him of sleep. “Bellowing like a bull”, “din”
and “cry” are likely to have been used to describe noise in the epic’s text,
although this is also considered to be ambiguous.<label for="sn15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn15" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Oden,
<a href="#b0240">1981</a><a name="bb0240"></a> </span> It is however clear that the result is
sleep disturbance.<label for="sn16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn16" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Millard, <a href="#b0205">1966</a><a name="bb0205"></a>, Oden, <a href="#b0240">1981</a><a name="bb0240"></a> </span> A second god,
Enki, defends humankind since the order to exterminate humans “ignored all
distinction between innocent and guilty”<label for="sn17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn17" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Moran,
<a href="#b0215">1971</a><a name="bb0215"></a> </span> and helps Atrahasis’ group to avoid the
extinction brought by the deluge —in a reminiscence of Noah’s Ark biblical
narration. After the flood, a new order for mankind is planned on terms
acceptable to Enlil.<label for="sn18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn18" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Moran, <a href="#b0215">1971</a><a name="bb0215"></a> </span></p>

<p>Independently of whether the Atrahasis’ epic actually features the first
recorded reference to a noise complaint or not,<label for="sn19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn19" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Moran,
<a href="#b0215">1971</a><a name="bb0215"></a>, Oden, <a href="#b0240">1981</a><a name="bb0240"></a> </span> it certainly contains modern elements of noise control.
First, with the abatement of noise through the suppression of the source
(humankind), later recognising noise as an inherent characteristic of society,
and finally, agreeing that implementing noise mitigation measures (through new
actions or rules) may be an acceptable compromise.</p>

<h3 id="s0025">3.2. Early mention to noise in English law</h3>

<p>In thirteenth century London, noisy or unsavoury trades – such as tanners,
butchers and smiths – were restricted to specific areas of the city.<label for="sn20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn20" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Lucas, <a href="#b0175">1989</a><a name="bb0175"></a> citing Tempest and Bryan,
<a href="#bib422">1976</a><a name="bb0422"></a> </span> The National Archives contain a
petition, dated as early as 1302, from the Franciscan friars of Bury St Edmunds
in Suffolk to King Edward I, to relocate the courthouse further away from the
friars’ premises since <em>“when it rains and it is stormy the people seek refuge
for themselves and their horses in the church of the friars; at other times when
they are assembled the friars are unable to say mass because of the noise and
press of the people…</em>”.<label for="sn21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn21" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The National Archives, <a href="#b0280">1302</a><a name="bb0280"></a> </span> The King attended the friars’
petition. This reveals that noise has long been regarded as a nuisance in
English common law.</p>

<h3 id="s0030">3.3. Non-transport noise in England in the early modern age</h3>

<p>Noise as a common law nuisance is consolidated during the eighteenth century in
its present form. The ringing of church bells is discussed in the case law
<em>Martin vs Nutkin (1724), 2P. Wms. 266</em>.<label for="sn22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn22" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Kerse,
<a href="#b0150">1975</a><a name="bb0150"></a> </span> The case law <em>R v Smith (1725), 2 Str.
704</em> held that noise from a “speaking trumpet” was a public nuisance, and
therefore a crime, when used at night.<label for="sn23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn23" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Lucas,
<a href="#b0175">1989</a><a name="bb0175"></a> citing Gearty, <a href="#bib423">1986</a><a name="bb0423"></a> </span> London Metropolitan Police<label for="sn24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn24" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK
Parliament, <a href="#b0380">1829</a><a name="bb0380"></a> </span> is considered to be the first
modern police in England.<label for="sn25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn25" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Lyman, <a href="#b0180">1964</a><a name="bb0180"></a> </span> It was soon given powers to deal with anti-social
behaviour through section LIV on the prohibition of nuisances by persons in the
thoroughfares<label for="sn26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn26" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0375">1839</a><a name="bb0375"></a> </span>, which included noise in the streets and disturbance to
inhabitants at their homes due to noise.</p>

<p>Section 23 of the Municipal Corporations Act 1882<label for="sn27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn27" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK
Parliament, <a href="#b0360">1882</a><a name="bb0360"></a> </span> gave powers to councils to
make byelaws <em>“for prevention and suppression of nuisances not already
punishable in a summary manner by virtue of any Act in force throughout the
borough”</em>, and several local councils sent byelaws to the UK Secretary of State
for their approval. Noise occupied a prominent position among nuisances not
covered by any other Act, such as the Public Health Act 1875.<label for="sn28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn28" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0365">1875</a><a name="bb0365"></a> </span> Thus, nuisances in the
new proposed byelaws included: <em>“Every person who… shouts… or disturbs the
public peace”</em>; <em>“who sounds, beats, or plays”</em> some musical instruments;
<em>“procession or assemblage of people which by loud singing, shouting, or
bawling, or by drum, gong, wind or stringed musical instrument or other resonant
thing, or by grotesque action or disorderly behaviour causes a nuisance to the
inhabitants”</em>. Of a list of 28 byelaws received by the UK Secretary of State
between 1883 and 1886<label for="sn29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn29" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The National Archives, <a href="#b0275">1895</a><a name="bb0275"></a> </span> only 8 are classified as <em>“allowed”</em>. The rest are
classified as <em>“not proceeded with”</em>, <em>“not allowed”</em>, <em>“disallowed”</em> or
<em>“objected”</em>. The main reason for refusal was that it was considered that some
of the proposed byelaws, such as Luton’s, could become a <em>“restriction to
liberty”</em> since it could apply to the <em>“Waits at Christmas”</em>.<label for="sn30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn30" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A type of musical band in England and Scotland, which were abolished as a
result of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, but which remained over the
Christmas period </span> It continues: <em>“The very fact that it is obviously directed
against the Salvation Army is an objection”</em>.<label for="sn31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn31" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The Salvation
Army (TSA) is a Protestant Christian church. It has a tradition of having
musicians available. </span> Nevertheless, the refusal of byelaws to prevent musical
religious processions was not totally effective since accounts of reports of
disturbances due to using local byelaws against the Salvation Army appear on
record.<label for="sn32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn32" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The Guardian, <a href="#b0260">1891</a><a name="bb0260"></a> </span>
This exception continues in modern Britain where, in accordance with Section 79
of the Environmental Protection Act as modified by the Noise and Statutory

<h3 id="s0035">3.4. Evolution of transport in England</h3>

<p>Transport in medieval England included land, river and sea transport.<label for="sn36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn36" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Langdon and Claridge, <a href="#b0165">2011</a><a name="bb0165"></a> </span> Land

<p>Modern times saw the need for quicker transport able to carry heavier loads.
This required improving and extending the transport network, first with the
maintenance of roads and bridges<label for="sn39" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn39" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Cooper, 2006](#b0075)<a name="bb0075"></a> </span>, then with the expansion of ports and canals. The Highways
Act 1555<label for="sn40" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn40" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0385">1555</a><a name="bb0385"></a> </span> imposed the burden for highways maintenance on local
authorities, continuing the Anglo-Saxon “Trinoda necessitas” where highways
maintenance was the collective responsibility of the inhabitants of an area
rather than it being carried out by specialised labour.<label for="sn41" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn41" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Webb
and Webb, <a href="#b0390">1913</a><a name="bb0390"></a> </span> This became ineffective where
relatively small communities did not have the means to maintain major ways, such
as some communities along the route between London and Edinburgh. From the late
seventeenth century, Parliament increasingly took responsibility for repairing
and maintaining roads from local authorities.<label for="sn42" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn42" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament,
<a href="#b0325">2010a</a><a name="bb0325"></a> </span> This was done through Private Acts of

<h3 id="s0040">3.5. The defence of statutory authority</h3>

<p>The defence of statutory authority is a legal doctrine present in English law.

blanche</em>, which could exacerbate nuisances, but it requires <em>reasonable care</em>.<label for="sn49" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn49" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Moor, <a href="#b0210">2011</a><a name="bb0210"></a> </span> It also takes
account of a variety of considerations such as the specificity of the location,
the inevitability of the nuisance, the effect on statutory provisions, and the
bearing that negligence has on the defence.<label for="sn50" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn50" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Moor,
<a href="#b0210">2011</a><a name="bb0210"></a> </span></p>

<p>Linden <a href="#b0170">(1966)</a><a name="bb0170"></a> identifies the evolution of the
defence of statutory authority from medieval lords who could not be sued in
their own courts. The notion that “the King could do no wrong”, has long been
part of the common law<label for="sn51" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn51" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Linden, <a href="#b0170">1966</a><a name="bb0170"></a> </span> citing Holdsworth, History of English Law and Hapert and
James), which then evolved to protecting public officials in the performance of
public duty.<label for="sn52" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn52" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Moor, <a href="#b0210">2011</a><a name="bb0210"></a> cites
<em>Entick v. Carrington, 1765</em> as a case law which shows that such statutory
authorization was evident at that time </span> As Moor <a href="#b0210">(2011)</a><a name="bb0175"></a> states, “<em>Although the judgment in Entick failed to find such
authority, it did acknowledge that Parliament could authorise such interferences
with property rights by clear prescription; ‘if the Legislature be of that
opinion they will make it lawful’. This eighteenth-century judgment may seem
trivial, especially in the modern context of larger scale industrial nuisances
and pollution cases, but it indicates the origins of greater state infringement
on private property rights; something which was to continue over the following
century.”</em> The same statutory defence can apply to private enterprises when the
authority has allowed them.</p>

<p>Brubaker <a href="#b0060">(1995)</a><a name="bb0060"></a> citing Gimpel <a href="#b0115">(1976)</a><a name="bb0115"></a> sets the origin of statutory defence for nuisances in
medieval mining: <em>“Medieval mining regulations provide some of the earliest
examples of governments overriding common law property rights… in the
thirteenth century… the governments encouraged miners to prospect on private
property, allowed them to cut privately owned trees, and authorized them to
divert streams. To ensure that the miners’ victims couldn’t fight back, the
governments freed the miners from the jurisdiction of local magistrates.”</em></p>

<p>In relation to infrastructure, Bassford <a href="#b0020">(2007)</a><a name="bb0020"></a>
identifies the turnpike roads and harbours of the early eighteenth century as
the first major infrastructure projects which required immunity from suits in
nuisance, in order to install a toll for the use of a road or harbour dues
respectively. In 1663, counties by the road between London to York and so into
Scotland requested a levy toll. Webb &amp; Webb <a href="#b0390">(1913)</a><a name="bb0390"></a> state that <em>“On this petition Parliament fell back on certain
medieval precedents, and authorised, by a special statute… to erect gates and
levy tolls … to devote this revenue to specially repairing the pars of the
Great North Road within their respective jurisdictions.”</em></p>

<p>According to Webb &amp; Webb <a href="#b0390">(1913)</a><a name="bb0390"></a> <em>“the Surveyor
appointed by the new road authority is gradually invested with nearly all the
powers of the Parish Surveyor of Highways… He is authorised summarily to
suppress nuisance, and enabled to take compulsory without compensation from the
common or wastes, within the parish or without, or out of any river or brook,
whatever ‘gravel, chalk, sand or stones’ are needed for the mending or his road;
and to resort for this purpose also to private grounds, on payment merely of the
actual damage done.”</em> Littleton, in 1692, proposed the use of charges as <em>“Every
person ought to contribute to the repair of roads in proportion to the use they
make of, or the convenience which they derive from them.”</em> The law relating to
statutory authority would later be consolidated in cases primarily related to
railways.</p>

<h3 id="s0045">3.6. Railway noise and the consolidation of statutory defence</h3>

<p>The first claim for nuisance on railways was from the turnpike roads, which had
their own statutory defence authority. The first passenger railway line, the
Stockton and Darlington Railway,<label for="sn53" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn53" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Macauley, <a href="#b0185">1872</a><a name="bb0185"></a> </span> provides the first example of defence of statutory
authority applied to nuisance arising from railways. Taking on the experience of
turnpike roads, the Stockton and Darlington Railway was promoted through a
Private Act, a parliamentary tool by which powers or benefits are passed to
individuals or bodies (such as railways promoters) rather than to the general
public. Parliament's role was to arbitrate between the promoters of these
Private Acts and those affected by their projects, as well as to take account of
the public interest. Private Acts allow to take over, for instance, a communal
right of passage,<label for="sn54" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn54" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0335">2010c</a><a name="bb0335"></a> </span> acquire land through compulsory purchase<label for="sn55" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn55" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0325">2010a</a><a name="bb0325"></a> </span> and provide a statutory
defence against a nuisance claim, as explained in more detail below.</p>

<p>The Trustees of the Stockton and Barnard Castle Turnpike Road, as well as most
of the agricultural community around the railway line, complained to the company
running the railway that the locomotive engine frightened the horses, which
constituted an intolerable nuisance, and requested that the use of locomotives
be stopped. The case was heard in a criminal court in 1832. As cited by Jeans
<a href="#b0130">(1875)</a><a name="bb0130"></a> the following verdict was returned, which
we reproduce in full due to its relevance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“That the Act of Parliament empowered the company or persons
authorised by them to use locomotive engines upon the railway; that
the railway was made parallel and adjacent to the ancient highway;
that it did not appear whether or not the line could have been made in
this instance to pass at a greater distance; that the locomotive
engines on the railway frightened the horses of persons using the
highway as a carriage road; that the locomotives were of the best
construction known at the time, and the defendants used due care and
diligence in the management of them.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sentence was appealed and an additional judgement returned
remarking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“that an interference with the rights of the public must be taken to
have been contemplated by the Legislature, since the works of the
statute authorising the use of the engine were unqualified, and the
public benefit derived from the railways (whether it would have
excused the alleged nuisance at common law or not) showed at least
that there was nothing unreasonable in the clause of the Act of
Parliament giving such unqualified authority”.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the rest of the nineteenth and part of the twentieth century, several cases
known today as the ‘railway cases’, consolidated this view. These ‘railway
cases’ were reviewed in Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd 1981.<label for="sn56" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn56" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Willberforce et al., <a href="#b0415">1980</a><a name="bb0415"></a> </span> They highlight the
defence of statutory authority against nuisance claims and the duty of taking
reasonable care (or not to act negligently). Hammersmith &amp; City Railway Company
v. Brand (1869), reaffirmed decisions in R v. Pearse (1832) and Vaughan v. The
Taff Vale Railway Company (1860) in the terms that “<em>where Parliament by express
direction or by … implication has authorised the construction and use of an
undertaking or works, … is authorised with immunity from any action based on
nuisance.”</em> Geddis v. Proprietors of the Bann Reservoir (1878) states <em>“To this
there is made qualification, or condition, that the statutory powers are
exercised without negligence – that word here being used in a special sense so
at to require the undertaker, as a condition of obtaining immunity from action,
to carry out the work and conduct the operation with all reasonable regard and
care for the interest of other persons.”</em></p>

<p>Although the defence of statutory authority and the duty of care for industries
promoted through Private Acts are not typically challenged by Parliament or
judges, there is greater discussion on whether immunity should be linked to
compensation. Thus, Lord Edmund-Davies highlighted that <em>“…the absence of
compensation clauses from an Act conferring powers affords an important
indication that the Act was not intended to authorise interference with private
rights”</em> and referred to Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill (1881) 6 App. Cas.
193, at 203 and the other cases cited in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th
Edition, Vol. 1, para 196. However, he stated: <em>“But the indication is not
conclusive (see Edgington v. Swindon Corporation (1939))”</em> and gave support to
the appeal, which did not link immunity to compensation.<label for="sn57" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn57" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Willberforce et al., <a href="#b0415">1980</a><a name="bb0415"></a> </span> A different view
was held by Lord Keith of Kinkel, who felt that the Gulf Oil Refining Ltd (the
appellants) in Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd 1981<label for="sn58" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn58" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Willberforce et al., <a href="#b0415">1980</a><a name="bb0415"></a> </span> had only been given
by Parliament the right to ‘compulsory purchase’ and that <em>“The appellants
failed to include in their Act any reference to authority to operate, work or
use a refinery. If they had done so, Parliament might well have insisted on
provision for compensation.”</em> Lord Keith of Kinkel’s view was not supported by
the other Lords.</p>

<p>The compensation issue was also commented in a most recent UK Supreme Court
case, Coventry v. Lawrence (2014), where in section 90 Lord Neuberger<label for="sn59" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn59" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Neuberger et al., <a href="#b0230">2014</a><a name="bb0230"></a> </span> was of the view
that <em>“it seems wrong in principle that, through the grant of a planning
permission, a planning authority should be able to deprive a property owner of a
right to object to what would otherwise be a nuisance, without providing her
with compensation… This point is reinforced … the Planning Act 2008…
expressly excludes claims in nuisance… and … provides for appropriate
compensation where a neighbour would, but for section 158, have had a claim in
nuisance. It is also to be noted that section 76 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982
expressly excludes an action for nuisance owing to aircraft, but section 1 of
the Land Compensation Act 1973 provides for compensation for neighbours
(including in respect of nuisance by noise attributable to aircraft) when land
is developed as an ‘aerodrome’“</em>.</p>

<h3 id="s0050">3.7. Road vehicle noise</h3>

<p>In this section we present a different case from that of railways. Road traffic
noise in England enjoys statutory protection against nuisance claims. Motor cars
were introduced at the end of the nineteenth century. The Locomotive Act 1861<label for="sn60" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn60" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0050">1861</a><a name="bb0050"></a> </span> includes
the first speed limits for road vehicles: 10mph on any turnpike road or public
highway and 5mph through any urban area. However, in the same way as railways
originally encountered the opposition of canals and turnpike roads industries,
road motor vehicles found the opposition of the railways and canals sectors.
Extremely low speed limits (4mph on any turnpike road or public highway and 2mph
through any city, town or village) and a requirement to have at least three
drivers (one of them on foot at least 60 yards in front of the vehicle, carrying
a red flag to warn riders and drivers of horses) were approved just four years
later.<label for="sn61" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn61" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0045">1865</a><a name="bb0045"></a> </span>
These unreasonably low speed limits and the use of a warden were lifted by the
end the century. The warden was replaced by the obligation of an audible
warning: <em>“Every light locomotive [NB meaning every vehicle] shall carry a
bell or other instrument capable of giving audible and sufficient
warning…“</em>.<label for="sn62" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn62" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0355">1896</a><a name="bb0355"></a> </span></p>

<p>The replacement of the warden by a bell or horn did not come without issues. As
recorded by the Metropolitan Police in 1912,<label for="sn63" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn63" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Henry,
<a href="#b0125">1912</a><a name="bb0125"></a> </span> motor traffic noise became an issue due
to the excessive use of horn and failure to use silencers on exhausts: <em>“…
complaints of unnecessary and nerve racking noise made at night by the drivers
of motor vehicles… the Locomotives on Highways Act, 1896, and… the Motor Car
(Use and Construction) Order, 1904, places upon drivers the obligation of giving
an audible and sufficient sound by way of warning to other vehicles and
pedestrians, with a view to preventing accidents</em>…<em>”</em> However, the police
commissioner writing the circular stated that drivers used the <em>“audible
warning…where there is no hidden danger, and where the only danger is
attributable to reckless speed on part of the driver…thereby disturbing the
rest of residents…</em>”.<label for="sn64" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn64" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Henry, <a href="#b0125">1912</a><a name="bb0125"></a> </span> The devices causing nuisance were the “cut-out”,
prohibited by the Motor Cars (Use and Construction) Amendment Order 1912 (which
introduced the requirement that escape gases passed through a silencer), and
either electric horns or horns operated by the engine exhaust.<label for="sn65" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn65" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Henry, <a href="#b0125">1912</a><a name="bb0125"></a> </span></p>

<p>The need to measure which silencers were most effective raised several
questions – firstly, how to assess the “reduction in noise” provided by
the silencers but, most importantly, how to actually measure sound. The
first trials to set a standard were focused on silencers and under the
initiative of private associations rather than the Government.</p>

<p>In 1913 the Auto-Cycle Union tested silencers both aurally and with
audiometers.<label for="sn66" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn66" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Kaye, <a href="#b0145">1935</a><a name="bb0145"></a> </span> In
1927 “Certificates of Performance” were issued as “Audiometer records” , which
did not give any quantitative data relating to the motor cycle under test but
compared the degree of noise made with other well-known sounds.<label for="sn67" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn67" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Kaye, <a href="#b0145">1935</a><a name="bb0145"></a> </span></p>

<p>After the Motor Cars (Use and Construction) Amendment Order 1912, the
publication of motor cars acts and regulations accelerated in the 1930s.
The regulations focused on two parameters: the obligation of using a
silencer and the driver’s behaviour. Section 76 (NB 75 in some
references) stated that <em>“No motor vehicle shall be used on a road in
such manner as to cause any excessive noise which could have been
avoided by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the driver.”</em></p>

<p>Trespassing was an issue that the police encountered when enforcing the above
provisions. In a letter dated in 1934, it is stated that <em>“A constable
inspecting a silencer … if he touches the vehicle he commits a technical
trespass, and if he touches its driver, he commits a technical assault”</em>.<label for="sn68" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn68" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The National Archives, <a href="#b0270">1949</a><a name="bb0270"></a> </span></p>

<p>As road vehicles became more popular over the years, the police
highlighted that the issue was not the individual vehicles, unless the
driver behaved unreasonably – it was the flow of traffic. A first
example is shown in a series of letters dated 1936 <label for="sn69" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn69" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The National
Archives, <a href="#b0270">1949</a><a name="bb0270"></a> </span> where the reverend
of a church located next to a <em>“junction of three main roads”</em>
complained <em>“that his congregation is disturbed by noisy motor cycles”</em>.
The response of the Secretary of State illustrated the principle of best
practicable means/reasonability: <em>“It would appear inevitable …
traffic should cause a certain degree of noise… it is only in cases in
which excessive noise could have been avoided by the exercise of
reasonable care on the part of the driver that the police have power to
take action against the driver”.</em></p>

<p>A second example is as illustrated in a series of letters of 1938,<label for="sn70" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn70" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The National Archives, <a href="#b0270">1949</a><a name="bb0270"></a> </span> between UK
Government departments, the Berkshire Constabulary and Wokingham Council,
whereby regulations were not considered to be effective in relation to noise. A
leisure area known as “California in England” attracted <em>“a very heavy traffic,
comprising chars-a-banc, motor cars and motor cycles”</em>. The police was unable to
penalise individual vehicles which had been unduly noisy since the issue was
that <em>“vehicles arrive and leave in batches (NB which) increases the volume of
noise. The police have not observed cases of dangerous riding or excessive
speed”</em>.</p>

<p>A feature of the regulations introduced above is the absence of any type of
limits. To incorporate limits to the different parts of a car producing noise,
three reports were commissioned by the Departmental Committee on Noise in the
Operation of Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (the Kaye commission).<label for="sn71" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn71" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The National Archives, <a href="#b0270">1949</a><a name="bb0270"></a> </span> The first
report of 1935 versed on the units of, instrumentation types, methods of
measurement, different types of microphones and weighting curves.<label for="sn72" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn72" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Kaye, <a href="#b0145">1935</a><a name="bb0145"></a> </span> It introduced the need for
<em>“the use of ‘objective noise meters’ which should be tested, calibrated and
approved”.</em> An interesting observation made in the report is that <em>“While
universality of application cannot at present be claimed for such instruments,
their convenience may often outweigh their theoretical imperfections.”</em></p>

<p>The articles published in local newspapers about the publication of the
first report confirm the introduction of objective noise measurements in
detriment of aural judgements. The articles also illustrate two elements
that will be recurrent and still present nowadays:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The introduction of a noise limit per vehicle in addition to the speed limit: <em>“90 phons of noise when running at 30 m.p.h.”</em> at a lateral point 18 feet from the vehicle, representative of the average location of “<em>persons on the footway of a road”.</em></li>
  <li>The difficulty of ensuring that a unit as the phon (or nowadays the decibel) is understandable by the public. Thus, the proposed noise limits were compared to the 90 phons of noise in a busy typing office or the 90–95 phons at the interior of a tube train with open windows.</li>
</ul>

that instruments gave a reliable reading in comparison to an “aural impression”.</p>

<p>Although the issue with noise related to motor and exhausts had
partially been addressed, the problem with the use of electric horns
remained. Suggestions were made in order to prohibit <em>“the use of a
super-charges … just as cut-outs are forbidden.”</em> The report
continued: <em>“Complaints with regard to noise caused by motor vehicles
are generally directed towards inadequate silencers, noise mechanism of
the vehicle, noisy loads, or the use of excessively strident motor
horns, or the excessive use of motor horns by drivers. On all these
subjects, except stridency of motor horns, provision has been made in
the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations, 1931”</em>.<label for="sn75" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn75" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The

Government’s Minister of Transport reached an agreement with the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders to limit the loudness of most horns to
100 phons. The newspaper article highlighted that <em>“Because of the successful
outcome of the negotiations the Minister has decided not to proceed for the time

the loudness of horns.”</em>.</p>

<h3 id="s0055">3.8. Aircraft noise and statutory defence</h3>

<p>After WWII, when noise from rail and road had already been addressed,
the British jet industry took off thus incorporating a further noise
source into the environment. To protect this emergent industry, the
Civil Aviation Act 1949 sections 40 and 41<label for="sn76" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn76" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament,
<a href="#b0345">1949</a><a name="bb0345"></a> </span> abolished the right of civil
actions where regulations under the act were made. The Government
removed a fundamental right and moreover did not allow for compensation.</p>

<p>Aircraft operators were protected by Orders and Regulations under the Act from
an early stage. The same immunity was given to aircraft manufacturers after a
complaint by the owner of a farm next to Dunsfold airfield, near Guildford,
could have stopped the works of Hawker Aircraft Company.<label for="sn77" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn77" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Brook, <a href="#b0055">1954</a><a name="bb0055"></a>, UK Government, <a href="#b0310">1954a</a><a name="bb0310"></a>, UK Government, <a href="#b0315">1954b</a><a name="bb0315"></a> </span>
Aircraft noise continued to be a problem since the “new big jet aircraft” was
introduced in the late 1950 s —see reference to Boeing 707–120 and to Soviet
TU.104 in <a href="#b0305">UK Government, 1958</a><a name="bb0305"></a> or to the
“supersonic Concorde” of the mid 1970’s.<label for="sn77" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn77" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Government,
<a href="#b0295">1976</a><a name="bb0295"></a>, UK Government, <a href="#b0300">1969</a><a name="bb0300"></a> </span> The compromise in each case was to allow noisy aircraft
with the hope that technical advance would reduce noise levels in the future. In
the case, of the Soviet TU.104 potential time restrictions were discussed. On
the 1954 Hawker Aircraft Company case, the Cabinet meetings recorded the
following two points:<label for="sn78" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn78" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Government, <a href="#b0310">1954a</a><a name="bb0310"></a> </span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>(b) Criticism might well be directed in the debate against the drastic
provisions of sections 40 and 41 of the Civil Aviation Act, 1949. These
sections had abolished the right to bring an action for nuisance in any case
which was covered by an Order in Council made under the Act, and had also
provided that no compensations should be payable in this connection.</em></p>

  <p><em>(c) It would be undesirable to reopen the way to any form of
compensation in cases of this kind, since this would expose the
Government to numerous claims in respect of R.A.F airfields and
possibly airfields in use by the United States Forces.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="s0060">3.9. The Noise Abatement Act 1960, the Wilson Committee, the Scott Committee and the entrance to the European Economic Community</h3>

<p>The recurrent concern to the cost of noise mitigation is highlighted in the
following sentence from a UK Cabinet meeting in relation to the establishment of
a future committee on noise:<label for="sn82" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn82" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Government, <a href="#bib421">1959</a><a name="bb0421"></a> </span> “<em>There was some pressure on the Government, both in and
outside Parliament, to take action for the abatement of noise; and, in view of
this and of the complexity of the problem, there was a good case for the
appointment of a committee of enquiry… Discussion showed that there was a
general agreement with this proposal. The danger that the committee might make
recommendations which would prove unduly expensive might be mitigated by care in
securing a suitable chairman</em>…”. The Noise Abatement Act 1960<label for="sn83" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn83" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0340">1960</a><a name="bb0340"></a> </span> made noise (a

nuisance or injurious to health”. In the Public Health Act 1936, this was
reworded as “a nuisance or prejudicial to health”. However, noise was only
specifically cited as a form of “nuisance” into the Noise Abatement Act, 1960.
The Environmental Protection Act 1990 defined noise as being “prejudicial to
health or a nuisance” in line with the advice in the World Health Organization’s
Environmental Health Criteria 12.<label for="sn85" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn85" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">WHO, <a href="#b0405">1980</a><a name="bb0405"></a> </span></p>

<h2 id="s0065">4. Conclusions</h2>

<p>Atrahasis’ epic shows that noise (and its mitigation) is not a recent occurrence
—it was already present in antiquity, at least as early as urban societies
appeared. In England, nuisance in common law has been dealing with noise since
medieval times. To understand the evolution in the law of noise, this paper has
approached two main questions. The first, whether the current interpretation of
the law of noise is the same as its original intent. Railways provide the
primary example to affirm that the law of noise has remained notably stable over
time. The findings of the first railway case, R v. Pearse (1832) were still
vindicated in Allen v. Gulf Oil Refining Ltd 1981, which reviewed the law of
nuisance in relation to enterprises approved by a Private Act. The second matter
addressed in this paper is that the same laws do not apply to all forms of
transport. Railways, roads and aircraft are all of significant economic
importance. They were put in one way or another under the protection of
statutory authority, which in practice restricted rights existing in common law,
such as the right to raise a claim on nuisance grounds. However, the tools to
make a claim are different for each of these means of transport.</p>

<p>Unlike road and aircraft noise, the statute (the Environmental
Protection Act 1990 as amended) does not specifically provide railway
noise with statutory protection against nuisance claims. Nevertheless,
common law allows a defence of statutory authority to railways, the
reason being that railways were allowed through Private Acts. The
defence of statutory authority applied to railways is still the model
for cases of nuisance related to all types of enterprises allowed
through a Private Act. The defence applied to railways evolved from the
same defence applied to turnpike roads and at the same time the defence
applied to turnpike roads evolved from some medieval precedents likely
to be related to mining and, roads and bridges maintenance. Defence of
statutory authority is linked to a test of reasonable care.</p>

<p>Conversely, road traffic and aircraft enjoy statutory protection against
nuisance claims. Deprived of common law remedies – such as injunction and
damages –, policy tools come on stage. In this vein, <a href="#b0210">Moor (2011)</a><a name="bb0210"></a> claims that <em>“Parliament has […] been quite reluctant to
show a clear and explicit intention to remove citizen’s private rights, and
express statutory authority has appeared in very few legislative provisions…
Where immunity has been awarded, it has generally only been successfully
received when juxtaposed with some form of statutory remedy”.</em> For instance,
through the Land Compensation Act 1973. However, in the same way as the courts
accord a similar meaning to the expression nuisance in its statutory context, as
they do to its meaning at common law,<label for="sn95" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn95" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Adams and McManus,
<a href="#b0010">1994</a><a name="bb0010"></a> </span> compensation has been extended to railway
schemes. This is the case of The Noise Insulation (Railways and Other Guided
Transport Systems) Regulations 1996 developed in line with section 20 of the
Land Compensation Act 1973. Even if railways are not specifically mentioned in
the Act, public works may be interpreted flexibly. Current legislation and
policy incorporate a distinction between different categories of noise effects:
nuisance or prejudicial to health, quality of life or health effects, and
adverse or significant adverse effects.<label for="sn96" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn96" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Defra,
<a href="#b0080">2010</a><a name="bb0080"></a>, MHCLG, <a href="#b0190">2021a</a><a name="bb0190"></a>, MHCLG, <a href="#b0200">2019</a><a name="bb0200"></a> </span> Guidance
describes potential effects as a consequence either of changes in noise levels
compared to a prevailing acoustic environment, or as absolute noise levels –
the latter usually related to loud noises.<label for="sn97" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn97" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">MHCLG,
<a href="#b0200">2019</a><a name="bb0200"></a> </span> All these distinctions assist to address
the requirements under the Environmental Impact Regulations<label for="sn98" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn98" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament, <a href="#b0320">2017</a><a name="bb0320"></a> </span> which separately identify
nuisances and risks to human health.</p>

<p>Further research and future evolution in law is likely to approach the following
areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The economic element of the suppression of actions on nuisance. Either through
direct compensation, or encouraging innovation in noise mitigation and
abatement beyond the requirement of reasonable care. The need for compensation
in exchange for a statutory defence is not yet conclusive. However, a trend
seems to exist in that direction.<label for="sn99" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn99" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Government,
<a href="#b0085">1996</a><a name="bb0085"></a>, UK Government, <a href="#b0095">1975</a><a name="bb0095"></a>, UK Parliament, <a href="#b0100">1973</a><a name="bb0100"></a>,
Neuberger et al., <a href="#b0230">2014</a><a name="bb0230"></a> </span> In relation to
industries, such as railways, that enjoy a defence of statutory authority, one
could question if the test of reasonable care (or lack of negligence) is
limiting innovation in nuisance mitigation and abatement, which would likely
occur if the law required a fixed part of the operating budget be intended for
research. Even more at a time when simulation (usually cheaper than the
construction of pilot machinery or plant) is commonplace in the mechanical
industry.</li>
  <li>The distinction between noise as a nuisance and noise as prejudicial to
health. <em>“It is acknowledged that further research is required to increase our
understanding of what may constitute a significant adverse impact on health
and quality of life from noise.”</em><label for="sn100" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn100" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Defra, <a href="#b0080">2010</a><a name="bb0080"></a> </span></li>
  <li>Whether it is worth retaining different legislative and regulatory approaches
to different types of noise sources. This is also relevant considering that
new noise sources such as wind farms or drones have been introduced in the
acoustic environment recently, and their presence is likely to increase
gradually. The current policy and regulatory frameworks contain a mix of tools
which address all types of noise in the same way<label for="sn101" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn101" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">European
Parliament and Council of the European Union, <a href="#b0110">2002</a><a name="bb0110"></a> </span> and others which retain a different approach depending
on the type of noise.<label for="sn102" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn102" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">UK Parliament <a href="#b0090">(1990)</a><a name="bb0090"></a> —also WHO <a href="#b0395">(2018)</a><a name="bb0395"></a> which
provides noise thresholds and targets based on the noise source rather than
based primarely on the type of noise sensitive receptor as previously Berglund
et al, <a href="#b0030">1999</a><a name="bb0030"></a> </span></li>
  <li>Soundscaping, which is defined as the combination of sounds that form an
immersive environment, is currently being introduced in policy guidance.<label for="sn103" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn103" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">MHCLG, <a href="#b0195">2021b</a><a name="bb0195"></a>, MHCLG,
<a href="#b0200">2019</a><a name="bb0200"></a> </span> Research may be necessary to define
whether soundscaping requirements are already present in law or need to be
specifically incorporated, as these could form an interesting counterpoint to
define nuisance in a localised context.</li>
